2023/06/22-2023/07/03 How to balance 28 hours/week in Tenessee Pass Cafe kitchen (I must work to feed myself and my son) and summer activities, with Fellowship. I must prioritize motherhood which means I may not be able to participate unstipened.

2023/07/06 received email from Josh Davis letting me know I was not chosen to be stipened. I have placed my Chicago condo "for rent" on zillow and received many applications immediately. Had showing yesterday despite the thunderstorms. I will be relocating to Colorado and/or Zuzalu. My son is choosing to attend school in the district of his father. I feel like he is appreciating the structure of education. A structure I wish to develop with better resource allocation, encoding the value of motherhood into protocol.
