:cupid: I feel called to research ECC [eliptical curve cryptography](https://blockchainhippy.io/2020/06/23/forking/). My background in psychedelics, pgp and trap artistry are some of the tools I'll use to research. I could conduct hands on experiments to expand my electromagnegtic field within the ethereum ecosystem. I have a passion for math and incentizing myself to succeed by making wizard-like internet personas [objects](https://antilop.cc/sr/users/selfsovereignty/threads/20121227-0612-I_fantasize_about_having_sex_with_you_people.html) of my desire. 

I volunteered at ETH Prague this week. It was reinvigorating. I am determined to focus my energy on ethereum research. I have a diverse set of blobs in my network.  My study of markets, investigative skills IRL and online, passionate devotion to core, and gold star status as a solo staked validator, instills dare i say god-given direction to this protocol. 


**Today I submit the application, watched the [town hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovwXAgP9LS8&t=1485s), and read in the [EF documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/) for about 5 hours. I also read about [KZG polynomial commitments](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2020/06/16/kate-polynomial-commitments.html) and [ECC](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/) by [Nick Sullivan](https://twitter.com/grittygrease)

***To support my application I received a [recommendation letter](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive)
